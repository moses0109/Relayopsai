# Demo Audio Script - Skeptical Business Owner

## Voice 1: Business Owner (Male, Skeptical Tone)
"I've heard about AI receptionists before, but they always sound robotic and can't handle real questions. How is yours different?"

## Voice 2: RelayOpsAI Agent (Female, Confident & Professional)
"That's the most common concern we hear! Our AI uses advanced conversational technology that sounds completely natural. We train it specifically on YOUR business - your services, your FAQs, your tone. It doesn't sound like a bot at all."

## Voice 1: Business Owner (Still Skeptical)
"Okay, but what happens when a customer asks something complicated? Does it just hang up or transfer them to a voicemail?"

## Voice 2: RelayOpsAI Agent
"Great question. Our AI is trained to handle your specific scenarios. If someone asks about scheduling, availability, or services, it answers confidently. For truly unique situations, it can intelligently capture the details and notify you immediately. Nothing falls through the cracks."

## Voice 1: Business Owner (Warming Up)
"And it works 24/7? Even after hours when I can't answer?"

## Voice 2: RelayOpsAI Agent
"Exactly. That's when it's most valuable. Your competitors are missing those late-night and weekend calls. We're answering them, booking appointments, and capturing leads while you sleep. Most businesses tell us they capture 20-40% more customers just from after-hours coverage alone."

## Voice 1: Business Owner (Interested)
"This actually sounds like it could work for my business. How do I get started?"

## Voice 2: RelayOpsAI Agent
"I'll send you a link to book a quick 15-minute call. We'll discuss your specific needs, show you exactly how it works for your industry, and get you set up in just a couple days. Sound good?"

## Voice 1: Business Owner
"Yeah, let's do it."
